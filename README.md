# AngularTaskTracker

The inspiration for creation of this project was a desire to discover Angular and Nest.js and compare them to React and Express. My conclusion upon completence of the project is that React is more flexible, but more vulnerable, and Angular in contrast is more secure hence it has more structure. Nest.js in it's turn is more convenient than vanilla Express, but it takes time to get used to it.

The project is connected to my [nestjs-task-tracker-backend](https://github.com/001elijah/nestjs-task-tracker-backend).
To run the project on your machine either clone the repository and run `npm start` or open the [GH live page](https://001elijah.github.io/angular-task-tracker/) the project is deployed on.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
